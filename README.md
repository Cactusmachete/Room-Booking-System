# Content Management System 

This CMS is a classroom-booking systems for colleges. It was built specifically for IIIT-Delhi. 

The project uses JavaFX & concepts of OOPs and Serialization. The system supports three levels of access - Admin, Faculty and Student, each with their own personalised dashboards.

Admin and Faculty users can book their rooms directly while Student users can only request rooms, which will have to be granted on a case-by-case basis by the Admin. Student users are given personalised time-tables based on the courses they add/drop through the application. 

This project was built as a part of the course - Advanced Programming (CSE201).
